# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

## The game
Ultimate tic-tac-toe is a "variation" of the famous tic-tac-toe game. Each square of the original grid is repalced with... another tic-tac-toe game. So you have to win 3 grids in a row to win. In addition, there are some move regulations. More info [here](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/).
